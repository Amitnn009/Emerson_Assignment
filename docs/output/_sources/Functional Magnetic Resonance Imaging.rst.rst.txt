1. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
======================================
A non-contrast enhanced, T2 weighted brain MRI using at least a 1.5 Tesla scanner
and a non-contrast enhanced 3D volumetric T1-weighted brain MRI will be
performed at baseline for all PPMI subjects. Therefore, it is required that the
radiology center (or person identified as responsible) transmit the MRIs to the
imaging core lab. All MRI sequences should be transmitted to the imaging core lab.

1.1 MRI Acquisition Procedures
-------------------------------
A 3D T1-weighted sequence (e.g. MPRAGE or SPGR) is required. The total scan
time is expected to be in the range from between 20 – 30 min. The field of view
(FOV) must include the vertex, cerebellum and pons. **The T1-weighted image
must be acquired as a 3D sequence and have a slice thickness of 1.5 mm or
less with no interslice gap**. All other parameters including repetition (TR) and
echo (TE) time should follow your manufacturer recommendations for a T1-
weighted, 3D sequence.
	 
   
=========================    ========================
Type of sequence			  T1-3D e.g. MPRAGE, SPGR
=========================	 ========================
Slice thickness (mm)		  1.2
Interslice gap (mm)			  1.0
Voxel size (mm)				  1*1*1.2
Matrix						  256 x 256 x 170-200
Plane						  Sagittal
=========================	 ========================

1.2 MRI Local Read Requirement (Baseline Only)
-----------------------------------------------
The MRI scan obtained at the Baseline visit will be read by the local site’s
radiologist to meet the standards for clinical practice and ensure there are no
significant abnormalities. The radiologist should provide a read interpretation that
the scan results are normal, abnormal (not clinically significant), or abnormal
(clinically significant). This documentation will be maintained in the study source
files at the clinical site. The radiologist’s interpretation is captured on the MRI data
form. The radiologist’s clinical interpretation is not required as eligibility criteria to
complete the enrollment process.
