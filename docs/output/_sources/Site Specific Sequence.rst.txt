3. Site Specific Sequence
======================================
3.1 Non-DTI / Non-resting-state site Procedures
------------------------------------------------
Non-DTI sites will use designated 3D-T1 and T2 sequences from the ADNI
protocol. See the **PPMI Site and ADNI Protocol Spreadsheet** sent
separately.
For any sites currently using a 1.5T scanner, we suggest upgrading to a 3T
scanner if possible. If you switch scanners, you must first inform IND and the
proper sequences will be sent to you.
It is imperative to review the PPMI Site and ADNI Protocol Spreadsheet
that has been sent separately by e-mail. Make sure that PPMI has the correct
Scanner and Software listed for your site. If there are any changes, please
inform the core imaging lab as soon as possible. Also, review the sequences
you will be using from the ADNI protocol.
Prior to running the first PPMI subject with the new ADNI sequences at a site,
please use the specified ADNI sequences to scan a phantom (see section 5)
and upload the images to the imaging core lab. The phantom will be reviewed
to make sure you are using the correct sequences.
	 
3.2 DTI / resting state site Procedures   
----------------------------------------
DTI / Resting state sites will use PPMI provided sequences AND certain ADNI
sequences. The old 3D-T1 sequence from the PPMI protocol will be run in
order to maintain longitudinal continuity. The new ADNI 3D-T1 sequence will
be run to allow future standardization The T2, DTI and resting state sequences
will be from the PPMI protocol.
Prior to running the first PPMI subject with the new ADNI 3D-T1 sequence
please scan a phantom with just the new ADNI sequence, and upload the
images to the core imaging lab. The phantom will be reviewed to make sure
you are using the correct sequence. For more information, refer to the
